I hope the secrets are clear enough for a game jam, but in case they are not I've here are a list of hints to to help uncover them.

I would recommend going 1 hint at a time, as each secret leds to the next.



Hint 1: Look for stick figures in the background to discover the secret mechanics.



Hint 2a: The first hint is near the top left, in the climbinging section.

Hint 2b: You can wall jump by holding L on your keyboard or the LEFT BUTTON on your controller.



Hint 3a: The second hint is in the very top left.

Hint 3b: You will need to use wall jump to take a different path around the top left to get to the second hint.

Hint 3c: Press J and K or LEFT and RIGHT shoulder buttons simultaniously to dash.



Hint 4a: The third hint is in the center at the very top.

Hint 4b: You will need to use your dash to get to the third hint.

Hint 4c: Double click I or the LEFT STICK to flip gravity.
